- Intro. / bkgd slides:
	- Pipeline diagram & where we're starting
	- Poisson vs Negative Binomial (previously covered)
	- Empirical Bayes gene-wise dispersion estimates (previously covered)
	- Brief intro to linear models w/ analogy to a straight line
	- Motivation for the linear model
	- What are we testing? => coefficients â‰  0
	- Distinction between parameter estimates and p-values
	- Programming pipes

- Analysis:
	- Intro. to dataset
		- explain expt. design
		- mention pre-filtering (kept transcripts w/ >= 50 mapped reads)
	- No intercept & 1 grouping variable
		- Test several specific hypotheses
	- W/ intercept & an interaction term
		- Graphical explanation of interaction term
		- How to test an interaction in the "No intercept & 1 grouping variable" setup ??

- Q & A:
	- What are some experimental designs that you'd like to know how to handle in edgeR? (*rephrase for brevity*)
